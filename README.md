This is Project 1 Agile and Scrum, My project will be about creating a flight booking system which will be managed and source controlled via github.

the use of the .gitignore extension is to filter or block out parts of the code that deals with sensitive information

The branching to be utilized is the branching method introduced during the lecture where there are four layers. Master, Hotfix, Develop and feature respectively. The main branch is master where the creation of each version system begins if there are an bugs the hotfix is applied and then given a new version again on the branch of master it depends on how bad or maybe how outdated the system is before being but under the development branch and then the feature branch is also used when something new is to be implemtedon the system.
